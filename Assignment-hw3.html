<h2 style="text-align:left; font-weight:bold; color:green;">Computational Neuroscience:</h2>

<p style="font-size:20px;">
In the simplest context, computational neuroscience will mean computation applied to the field of experimental or theoretical neuroscience. More often than not, mathematical models created in neuroscience related computer softwares use artificial neural network. These computer models can mimic the brain, sometimes underestimating the fact that the actual human brain contains billions of neurons that connect together in an optimized way to make a hugely efficient structure, that can perform most complicated tasks in a fraction of a second. 
        </p>
<p style="font-size:20px;">
Standard mathematical predictive models can mimic brain networks using 100s or 1000s of virtual units, that can simulate the electro-chemical properties of neurons. The lack of dimension is well balanced in these mathematical models by the power of their underlying mathematical algorithms, very well designed to approximate the efficiency of a real mammalian brain.

<h2 style="text-align:left; font-weight:bold; color:green;">Artificial Intelligence:</h2>
   
<p style="font-size:20px;">
Artificial Intelligence uses the concepts of computational Neuroscience to build a software or an entire machine (or robots) that is as intelligent as a normal human being. The artificial intelligence based software uses an underlying artificial neural network, that is equipped with a particular mathematical model, and is built specifically to perform quickly and intelligently one single task, like character or digit recognition. Many such softwares can be put together to make a robot that can perform many tasks in parallel and can even discriminate between human moods and emotions.

<p style="font-size:20px;">
Artificial intelligence labs use various coding languages, frameworks and platforms to build their trainable artificial network. C++, Python and Matlab are some of the popular languages and platforms utilized to build AI based networks. Below is a short description of all the python AI modules I am currently working with.

<h2 style="text-align:left; font-weight:bold; color:green;">Python and Artificial Intelligence:</h2>
 <p style="font-size:20px;">
 Python is a scripting language, that's been widely used these days to compute mathematical algorithms, for artificial intelligence or otherwise. 
<br>
Here is a comprehensive list of all the python modules I am currently learning to use. All of these use artificial neural network, and are suitable for building machine learning based programs.

</ul>
<p style="font-size:20px;">
Using some or all of the above modules, I plan to build a program that would be able to extract text from natural images with ~99% accuracy.
